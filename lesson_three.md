* used https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/web-templates/how-to-create-a-horizontal-navigation-bar-in-html-and-css/ for main layout of navigation, but I put my name and seedling icon before it
* used https://coolors.co/palettes/trending for font color
* used https://fontawesome.com/icons/seedling?f=classic&s=solid for seedling icon and chatgpt for help with getting it set up
