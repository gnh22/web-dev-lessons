# Lesson #1: Fighting with Github (and winning!)

So, my first struggle with my website was getting it configred properly in github. I had a github pages repository before, but I wanted
to start again from the beginning, making sure I really understand the process, and that proved to be a bit finicky.

I first deleted my repository on github, but I don't think I properly deleted my repository locally because when I went to clone it after
setting up a new github pages, it didn't ask me where I wanted to store it but just had me open it... suspicous.

After experimenting with some things, I finally had the sense to delete the entire folder that my original clone had been in, and then when I 
tried to clone it in github it told me it could not locate it (success!), so I hit remove, and then when I went to clone it again, it actually let me clone it and pick a location on my device. 

Now my environment is set up!
